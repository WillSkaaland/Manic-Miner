/* <p><a href="#">cursor test</a> make sure to create the cursor so you don't have to hover</p> 

turns out this code up here, it was coding a mouse cursor to change when hovering over a clickable, think how when hovering over an item it sometimes will change your mouse to a finger wit one hand or the line thing to click on text. Maybe I could make <a> be the tiles so it changed when you hover over it.
